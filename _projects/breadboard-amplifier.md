This project involved designing and building a small audio amplifier using a classic **LM386** operational amplifier. The goal was to create a portable speaker that could amplify the output of a smartphone or laptop.

Key points:

* Designed the circuit to operate from a single 9 V battery.
* Implemented a gain control potentiometer and a tone control network.
* Laid out the circuit neatly on a breadboard for quick testing.
* Measured frequency response with an oscilloscope to verify performance.

A future iteration will involve designing a custom PCB for improved durability.
