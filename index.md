Name: Jeeves
Role: Electrical Engineering Student
Focus: Integrated Circuit Design (ICD)

Summary:
  An aspiring electrical engineer passionate about the design and analysis of integrated circuits. I enjoy exploring how electrons can be sculpted into complex logic and analog functions, from transistor‑level schematics to digital architectures. My coursework and projects span breadboard prototyping, PCB layout, Verilog/VHDL coding, and SPICE simulation. I’m seeking opportunities to apply these skills in semiconductor and IC design roles.
